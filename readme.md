### Speaker One 

A coffee table book sized speaker based on the [SB Acoustics SB16PFCR25-4-COAX](https://sbacoustics.com/product/6-sb16pfcr25-4-coax/), a 40W 6" Coaxial driver, inspired by (copied from) Ojas Artbook speakers.  

My goals with this project:  
* I'd never made a speaker before, and wanted to try 
* I was super inspired by the [Ojas Artbook](https://ojas.nyc/products/ojas-bookshelf-speaker-kit-v1-0) speaker kit, but they were out of stock, in the US and a little to big and expensive for me. 
*
