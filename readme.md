This a note about building a coffee table book sized speaker based on the [SB Acoustics SB16PFCR25-4-COAX](https://sbacoustics.com/product/6-sb16pfcr25-4-coax/), a 40W 6" Coaxial driver, inspired by (copied from) Ojas Artbook speakers. It is not a ready-to-build kit. 

My goals with this project:  
* I'd never made a speaker before, and wanted to try. 
* I was super inspired by the [Ojas Artbook](https://ojas.nyc/products/ojas-bookshelf-speaker-kit-v1-0) speaker kit, but they were out of stock, in the US and a little to big and expensive for me. 
* I don't really have the space or the confidence to do any serious woodwork (cutting and routing) so wanted to try ordering CNC cut parts and glueing them together. 
* I wanted something that would sound and look better than the Q Acoustics 3010 speakers I bought from Richer Sounds a few years ago. I wanted reasonably deep bass, decent volume from a little digital amp and a sound that wasn't boxy. 

Caveats: 
* These are not super precisely designed speakers. If you have the patience to model everything properly, I'm sure you can do better. 
* This is NOT a ready-to-go kit you can just send to a CNC place and build easily. The design in the attached Illustrator file is **not correct** — I'll explain why below, and you can maybe modify it to work better.
* For the money you'll spend on parts, you can probably buy a better speaker. If you include your own time at minimum wage, you can buy a much better speaker. 

Bill of Materials & Tools: 
* Wooden parts, cut from 18mm (nominal) Plywood. Use the best plywood you can get, in the UK in 2022 it's hard to get high grade (B/BB) Birch Ply, this was built from good quality (BB/BB) ply. This was expensive - over £300 with a few other parts, there may well be ways to optimise the process and certainly cheaper ways to cut the simple parts. 
* Drivers: SB Acoustics SB16PFCR25-4-COAX 6" Coaxial Speaker × 2, ~£40 each from [Willys Hifi](https://willys-hifi.com/products/sb-acoustics-sb16pfcr25-4-coax-6-coaxial-speaker) 
* Cable: I used 1mm three core mains cable, other cables exist. 
* M4 bolts, washers, nuts to attach the driver to the front of the box.
* M3 hex brass standoffs to mount the crossover into the...
* M3 Rivet Nuts which I hammered into the wood.
* Female Spade Terminals in 2.8mm and 4.8mm to connect wires to the speakers.
* Crossover Parts: 
    * I built the crossover suggested [specified by SB Acoustics](https://sbacoustics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Crossover-for-PFC-or-PAC-Coaxial-Drivers.pdf) using what seemed like crazy giant components, all from Willys Hifi again. The parts cost about £50(!), half that on six polypropylene capacitors alone. Electrolytic caps would have been much cheaper: 
    * HiFi Crossover Inductor 1.5mH Iron Core × 2
    * 0.22mH Audyn Crossover Inductors, Air Core, 0.71mm OFC Wire, 3% Tolerance. × 4
    * 15uF Audyn CAP Q4 MKP Polypropylene Capacitors 400V 5% × 4
    * 5.6uf Audyn CAP Q4 MKP Polypropylene Capacitors 400V 5% × 2
    * 1.5 Ohm 10 Watt 5% Ceramic Wirewound Resistor × 2
    * All built on two [120x80mm proto boards](https://www.bitsboxuk.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=238_244&products_id=2324) from Bitsbox.
    * Various screw terminals I happened to have in stock. 
* Monacor BP-420 Nickel Plated Binding Posts × 2





Tools and consumables 
* Gorilla Glue: Worked really well, parts were firmly held after 30-45 minutes clamped, then solid after 24 hours. I didn't use any screws or other fixings, except on the back panel which needs to be removable.  
* 90 Degree Positioning Clamps: these are fairly expensive aluminium clamps, copies of the [Woodpeckers original](https://www.woodpeck.com/clamping-squares-plus.html) which is are very expensive. The squares were essential, but the clamping mechanisms are a bit fiddly. I'd proably use normal clamps with the aluminium squares. If I was being clever, I'd have had some right angles milled out at the wood place. 
* Other clamps. These [Stanley band clamps](https://www.stanleytools.co.uk/product/0-83-100/450-mm15-baileyr-band-clamp) were cheap and pretty useful, but two huge Sash Clamps I had from another project were essential. 
* I used a [Stanley Surform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surform) to reduce the thickness of sections where I'd failed to specify the tolerances properly. Sometimes the right tool is just the tool you have handy.
